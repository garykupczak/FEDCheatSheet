# Front-End Developer Cheat Sheet

This guide covers topics that I’ve found come up in interviews fairly frequently. In-depth knowledge of every item on the following lists is not absolutely necessary, but you should be able to at least talk about them intelligently, should they come up.

Note: Items marked with * are not usually necessary, but will score you bonus points

## JavaScript
DOM access methods (without a library)

Basic types (strings, integers, booleans, etc)

Looping structures

Variable scope and hoisting

Event handling

Object syntax

hasOwnProperty

Closures, callbacks, and anonymous methods

Same origin policy/CORS:
- how it applies to AJAX
- how JSONP gets around this

jQuery:
- what it is (framework vs. library)

- plugins:
  - what they are
  - how to use them
  - how to write them

Common problems/misconceptions with JavaScript:
- lack of namespaces
- unexpected comparison behaviors (“truthy” vs. “falsey”, == vs. ===)
- NaN vs. null vs. undefined

The “this” keyword:
- what it is
- how to use it
- how it changes with execution scope, particularly anonymous methods

Arrays:
- creation (different methods of)

- comparison operators (ie, === vs. ==)
- object properties and object methods
- “unobtrusive” vs. “obtrusive” JavaScript implementations
- event bubbling and event capturing
- static and dynamically typed languages*
- compiled and interpreted languages*
- classical and prototypal inheritance*
- design patterns*

JavaScript vs Java:
- dynamic, weakly typed vs. static, strongly typed
- interpreted at run time vs. compiled
- prototypical vs. classical inheritance

## HTML
Appropriate and inappropriate usage of table elements

IDs vs. classes, and how this applies to the interaction between JavaScript and CSS

What the doctype is, and how it works (particularly for IE)?

What is the DOM?

Page optimization

Why should you combine and compress external resources?

Why should you load scripts at the end of the page?

Appropriate usage of different image formats

Semantic markup

Write W3C valid markup* (do this anyway, but none of my employers have ever validated my markup)
SEO*

Templating languages (HAML, Jade, etc)*

## CSS
IE hacks:
- Wacky IE CSS selector hacks (underscore, tick, asterisk, etc)

- How margin, padding, and border affect the width of an element

Selector specificity, and how it may affect performance

What floats are, and how to use them

What CSS “reset” and "normalize" utilities are, and what they do

What “clearfix” is, and how it is used

Defining sizes: pxs vs. ems vs. pts vs. percentages

What !important does, and why you shouldn’t use it

External vs. inline styles, and why external styles are preferable

Media types

Media queries (particularly in regards to mobile devices and pixel density)

CSS frameworks and grid systems (Bootstrap, 960 GS, Blueprint)*

CSS preprocessors (LESS, SASS/Compass, Stylus), and why they are useful*

Be able to explain the differences between:
- values of the display attribute (block, inline, none, etc)
- values of the position attribute (absolute, relative, fixed, etc)
- display: none and visibility: hidden

How to use:
- pseudo-elements
- attribute selectors

### Major Bonus Points*
A GitHub account (seriously, people are super-impressed with this for some reason)

Working knowledge of:
- jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile
- HTML5 Boilerplate
- CSS3 PIE, Moderinzr
- JSLint, JSHint
- CSS Lint
- popular CMSes (Wordpress, Django, etc)
- optimization techniques
- images & CSS spriting
- scripts (combination, compression, minification/packing)
- CSS (combination, compression, minification)

General knowledge of:
- graphic design, UI/UX design, and usability
- JavaScript MVC/MVVM frameworks (backbone, ember)
- Accessibility and Section 508 compliance
- Unit testing/test-driven development
- Agile development practices
- NodeJS
- Coffeescript

## Interview Advice
When someone comes into an interview and seems to know how to do *everything* I assume it means they don’t know how to do any of it as good as I want them to.  Answer any questions you’re asked, but when summarizing your general knowledge, stick to topics specific to the position you are applying for.

When asked about a particular topic you’re not an expert on, don’t be afraid to say you know about something, even if you’ve never used it - but be honest.

I like it when people can talk about what books, blogs, etc they’ve read to keep current with their craft.

Being able to speak of personal projects usually scores you points because it shows that you are genuinely interested in web technologies, outside of what you do for work.
